Been wanting to scrape my Arris SB8200 modem signals for monitoring over time, new firmware requires a login to access the signals.  Finally that was annoying enough I had to figure out how to automate it a bit - but first had to figure out how the login auth works.

New firmware, to see your signals and status requires login...here are the defaults:
Username: admin
Password: (the last 8 digits of your modem's serial number)
